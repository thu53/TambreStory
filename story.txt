Tambre has a dog named Peter. Peter is very lazy and loves to sleep on Tambre’s bed when she is at class, and has lived happily like this for nearly 2 semesters. However, one day, when Tambre woke up in the morning, she accidentally knocked Peter off her lofted bed! But instead of falling on the ground, Peter was transported to Africa and teleported onto a running giraffe!

The giraffe was running so fast! Peter was a little scared, but the fun outweighed the terror. He opened his mouth and stuck his head up like he was in a car on the freeway. Peter felt amazing.

… Until a hungry lion attacks the giraffe. Terrified little Peter sees his life with Tambre flash before his eyes. Little did anyone know that Peter is only a stuffed animal, and therefore, cannot die.

Little Peter then woke up from the dream with the jolt. As he did Tambre walked through the door once again and noticed that he was laying face-flat on the floor.

That's strange, Tambre thought as she picked Peter up and put him back onto her bed. Once he was back on the bed, Peter sighed in relief as he was finally home. What a crazy dream he thought as he rolled around to go back to sleep. As he rolled, he felt something on his fluffy tail and when he opened his eyes to look, he realized he was face to face with a drooling, raging lion.
